Bike Diary's design is meant to be content-focused and straightforward, without too much motion and color. So instead, we used a grayscale color palette to make the photographs stand out and a typographic scale that makes headlines and long texts easy to read. Any additional color is used to indicate information.

## Navigation

The application has a standard bottom navigation for navigating between main sections.

We currently have four main sections:

- Dashboard
- Feeds
- Map
- Profile

Any other section has an arrow for navigating back to the main sections
except for the Authentication screen.

### Dashboard section

### Feeds section

### Map section

### Profile section

## Color

The app has custom colors for light and night themes. But on Android version 12 and higher, users can use dynamic colors. Learn more about [dynamic colors](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/dynamic-color/overview).

## Typography

The app uses Roboto as the typeface and made use the material design 3 type scaling system.

The type scale is organise into five roles:

- Display
- Headline
